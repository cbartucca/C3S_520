    "Here we extract results from three recent scientific literature, which concentrate on evaluating ERA5 in its capability to correctly represent the wind speed both at surface and at the wind turbine hub heights, over those regions where the wind speed is significant for the wind energy production. Overall, ERA5 emerges as the most reliable and accurate reanalysis dataset across these studies, particularly excelling in representing near-surface winds, climatological patterns, and extreme weather events. Its high resolution and operational updates make it a valuable tool for climate studies and wind energy applications. However, caution is advised for long-term trend analysis, where a combination of multiple reanalyses is preferable.\n"

    "* ERA5 is the best-performing reanalysis for near-surface wind estimates and provides valuable climate information in near-real time, beneficial for various wind energy applications.\n",
    "* Accuracy: ERA5 shows good agreement with observational data across Europe. It successfully captures the spatial and temporal variability of wind speeds.\n",
    "* Biases: Some regional biases are noted, but overall, ERA5 performs better than previous reanalyses, such as ERA-Interim.\n",
    "* Climatological Patterns: ERA5 effectively reproduces climatological patterns and extremes, providing a reliable dataset for wind energy and climate studies.\n",
    "* Extremes: Both overestimation of light wind frequency and underestimation of strong wind frequency, and thus extreme events, is inherent in the nature of models.\n",
    "* Trends: A combination of several reanalyses is preferable when analysing long-term trends.\n"
