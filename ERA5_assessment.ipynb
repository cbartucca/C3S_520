    "Comparing model outputs with relevant observations allows one to detect and quantify the difference between the model and the observations. However, validating reanalysis products over remote areas is challenging due to the sparsity of reliable in-situ measurements. Here the ERA5 reanalysis is validated with data gathered during the 2022 and 2023 campaigns by the Aeroclipper platform [1]. The Aeroclipper is a quasi-Lagrangian balloon, providing in situ measurements of atmospheric parameters at heights of 30 to 40 metres over the ocean [[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236867248_The_Aeroclipper_A_New_Device_to_Explore_Convective_Systems_and_Cyclones), that are representative of the bottom of the boundary layer which interacts strongly with turbulent fluxes (momentum,\n",
    "energy, water) at the ocean-atmosphere interface. This balloon is an interesting instrument for evaluating the representation of the atmospheric surface layer by models and by meteorological reanalyses, because it can give high frequency, quality measurements - i.e. undisturbed by the mass of a ship - on quasi-Lagrangian trajectories, that can be compared to the gridded data. \n",

    "Analysis shows that the specific humidity above 10 m is underestimated by more than 1 g/kg. Underestimation of specific humidity on the three first levels of the model seems to be, at least partly, related to the assimilation process, which tends to dry these model levels at the beginning of each 12h assimilation window [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1256/qj.05.137). Then a moistening follows, but without reaching an equilibrium or a value close to those observed. At 2m, the drying due to the assimilation is smaller, and the moisture reaches an equilibrium after a few hours in the forecast, so specific humidity at 2 m is in better agreement with Aeroclipper measurements, but still with a negative bias COMMENT WITH THIE REFERENCE [[4]]. This leads to the conclusion that vertical gradients of moisture in the atmospheric surface layer are too large in ERA5 compared with Aeroclipper measurements."

    "Temperature measurements come from a PT1000 thermometer. Analysis shows that the air temperature of the first three model levels is underestimated by about 1 K in ERA5 compared to Aeroclipper measurements. In most cases, the temperature difference at 2m is similar to the temperature at the first three model levels and is sometimes even smaller. The bias seems to be due to overcooling of the surface layer by the model, particularly at night during the forecast, and corrected in part by the assimilation process [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1256/qj.05.137).

    "Regarding the temperature at the interface with the ocean, an IR radiometer makes radiometric equivalent brightness temperature available. These values have been compared with the ERA5 skin and sea surface temperature (SKT and SST). As expected, as the YTT flight covers the end of September, the ERA5 SKT is generally smaller than the ERA5 SST, with the exception of low wind speed conditions where a diurnal warm layer develops. At the same time, SKT is slightly larger than the radiative temperature measurement of the Aeroclipper. It should be noted that since there is no measurement of downward IR radiation at the surface, no correction has been applied to the Aeroclipper radiative temperature, partly explaining the ERA5 overestimation. The lower skin radiative temperature measured by the Aeroclipper may also be due in part to the absence of correction for radiative transfer between the surface and the radiometer, whereby the approximately 35 m of rather damp layer may affect the IR transmission in the water vapour continuum. Nevertheless, this result is in substantial agreement with the one in He et al., 2023 [[6]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243150), in which in-situ and satellite data are used to validate ERA5 near-surface air temperature over global oceans (see i.e. Fig 11). \n",
    "In conclusion, assuming that the SKT is well represented in ERA5, this study shows that vertical gradients of temperature in the atmospheric surface layer are too large in ERA5 compared with Aeroclipper measurements."

    "Analysis shows that the wind speed is underestimated by about 0.5 ms-1 in ERA5 compared to Aeroclipper measurements. The wind underestimation is greater during convective episodes associated with convective cold pools and large wind gust (see around September 22, for example). The underestimate of the wind speed therefore seems to be partly related to the lack of cold pool in the model. Also, there is a slight decrease in wind due to assimilation that is compensated for during the forecast. Here it can therefore be stated that in ERA5 there is a too small wind shear near the surface."
